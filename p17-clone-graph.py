Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label
and a list of its neighbors. 

Nodes are labeled uniquely. We use '#' as a separator for node 
label and each neighbor of the node. As an example, consider the
serialized graph {0, 1, 2#1, 2#2, 2}

undirected_graph = {
  #node: [list_of_connected notes],
  1: [2,3],
  2: [1],
  3: [1]
